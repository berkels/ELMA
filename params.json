{"name":"Elma","tagline":"ELectron Micrograph Analysis","body":"### ELMA - ELectron Micrograph Analysis\r\n\r\n__Version 1.0__\r\n\r\nELMA is a small tool for **denoising** and analyzing STEM images. The main application are **low-dose high-resolution STEM images** of inorganic materials that are extremely corrupted by **Poisson noise**. Currently, ELMA is focused on periodic crystals, but will be extended to more complex structures in the future.\r\n___\r\nExecutables are available for **Windows** and **MacOSX**.\r\n\r\nELMA supports **TIFF images**, as well as the following formats:\r\n* read: .tiff, .tif, .dm3, .dm4, .png, .q2bz\r\n* save: .tiff, .tif, .png, .q2bz\r\n\r\nImages must be in units of electron **electron counts / pixel**.\r\n___\r\n**LICENSE**: ELMA is distributed under the terms of [The MIT License](ELMA/README.md).  \r\nBasically, you are **free to use** and modify this software.
