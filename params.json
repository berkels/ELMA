{"name":"Elma","tagline":"ELectron Micrograph Analysis","body":"### ELMA - ELectron Micrograph Analysis\r\n\r\n__Version 1.0__\r\n\r\nELMA is a small tool for **denoising** and analyzing STEM images. The main application are **low-dose high-resolution STEM images** of inorganic materials that are extremely corrupted by **Poisson noise**. Currently, ELMA is focused on periodic crystals, but we intend to extend it to more complex structures in the future.\r\n___\r\nExecutables are available for **Windows** and **MacOSX**.\r\n\r\nELMA supports **TIFF** (integer & float) **input/output compatible with DigitalMicrograph**. The list of supported formats is:\r\n* **.tif**, **.tiff**, **.dm3** (read only) **.dm4** (read only), .png, .pgm, .q2bz\r\n\r\nImages must be in units of **electron counts / pixel**.\r\n___\r\n**LICENSE**: ELMA is distributed under the terms of the [Common Development and Distribution License](LICENSE.txt).  \r\nParticularly, you can **download and use** this software **free of cost**.  \r\n   \r\nWe appreciate any feedback on your experience with ELMA.
