{"name":"Elma","tagline":"ELectron Micrograph Analysis","body":"### ELMA - ELectron Micrograph Analysis\r\n\r\nVersion 1.0\r\n\r\nELMA is a small tool for denoising and analyzing High-Resolution STEM images.\r\nThe main application are low-dose STEM images of inorganic materials that are extremely corrupted Poisson noise.\r\nCurrently, ELMA is focused on periodic crystals, but will be extended to more complex structures in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nExecutables are available for both **Windows** and **MacOSX**.\r\n\r\nELMA can read & save TIFF images, as well as some other formats:\r\nread: .tiff, .tif, .dm3, .dm4, .png, .q2bz\r\nsave: .tiff, .tif, .png, .q2bz\r\n\r\nNote: images must be in units of electron counts / pixel\r\n\r\n\r\n**LICENSE (short)**:\r\nYou are free to use ELMA for scientific or other purposes but we ask you\r\nto cite our work in case you publish results that involve the use of ELMA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe complete license can be found in the file LICENSE.txt\r\nthat is part of this repository and accompanies the executables\r\nwe distribute for Windows and MacOSX.\r\nPlease use the most current citation from the following list\r\nin case you want to refer to our work:\r\n\r\n**[1]** N.
