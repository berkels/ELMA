### ELMA - ELectron Micrograph Analysis

Version 1.0

ELMA is a small tool for denoising and analyzing STEM images. The main application are low-dose high-resolution STEM images of inorganic materials that are extremely corrupted by Poisson noise. Currently, ELMA is focused on periodic crystals, but we intend to extend it to more complex structures in the future.

Executables are available for Windows and MacOSX at http://nmevenkamp.github.io/ELMA.

ELMA supports TIFF (integer & float) input/output compatible with DigitalMicrograph. The list of supported formats is:
* .tif, .tiff, .dm3 (read only), .dm4 (read only), .png, .pgm, .q2bz

Images must be in units of electron counts / pixel.

Particularly, you can download and use this software free of cost.
