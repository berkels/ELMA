### ELMA - ELectron Micrograph Analysis

Version 1.0

ELMA is a small tool for denoising and analyzing High-Resolution STEM images. The main application are low-dose STEM images of inorganic materials that are extremely corrupted Poisson noise. Currently, ELMA is focused on periodic crystals, but will be extended to more complex structures in the future.


Executables are available for both Windows and MacOSX.

ELMA can read & save TIFF images, as well as some other formats:
read: .tiff, .tif, .dm3, .dm4, .png, .q2bz
save: .tiff, .tif, .png, .q2bz

Note: images must be in units of electron counts / pixel
