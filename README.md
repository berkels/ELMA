### ELMA - ELectron Micrograph Analysis

__Version 1.0__

ELMA is a small tool for **denoising** and analyzing STEM images. The main application are **low-dose high-resolution STEM images** of inorganic materials that are extremely corrupted by **Poisson noise**. Currently, ELMA is focused on periodic crystals, but will be extended to more complex structures in the future.
___
Executables are available for **Windows** and **MacOSX**.

ELMA supports **TIFF images**, as well as the following formats:
* read: .tiff, .tif, .dm3, .dm4, .png, .q2bz
* save: .tiff, .tif, .png, .q2bz

Images must be in units of electron **electron counts / pixel**.
