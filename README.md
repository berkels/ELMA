### ELMA - ELectron Micrograph Analysis

__Version 1.0__

ELMA is a small tool for **denoising** and analyzing STEM images. The main application are **low-dose high-resolution STEM images** of inorganic materials that are extremely corrupted by **Poisson noise**. Currently, ELMA is focused on periodic crystals, but we intend to extend it to more complex structures in the future.
___
Executables are available for **Windows** and **MacOSX**.

ELMA supports **TIFF** (integer and float, **compatible with DigitalMicrograph**).   
The supported formats are: **.tif**, **.tiff**, **.dm3** (read only) **.dm4** (read only), .png, .pgm, .q2bz

Images must be in units of **electron counts / pixel**.
___
**LICENSE**: ELMA is distributed under the terms of the [Common Development and Distribution License](LICENSE.txt).  
Particularly, you can **download and use** this software **free of cost**.
